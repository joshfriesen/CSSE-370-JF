    <h2><i>Trees</i> by Joyce Kilmer</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>I think that I shall never see<br/>A poem lovely as a tree.</p>
    <p1>A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br/>Against the earth's sweet flowing breast;</p1>
    <p2>A tree that looks at God all day,<br/>And lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p2>
    <p3>A tree that may in Summer wear<br/>A nest of robins in her hair;</p3>
    <p4>Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br/>Who intimately lives with rain.</p4>
    <p5>Poems are made by fools like me,<br/>But only God can make a tree.</p5>
